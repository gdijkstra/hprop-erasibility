* Title slide
Programming in homotopy type theory and erasing propositions
* Outline presentation?
** Introduction \hott
** Erasing propositions
* Homotopy type theory
** Introduction
*** Introduce it in vague terms
*** Recall Curry-Howard correspondence: table
*** Extend table with homotopy interpretation
*** We can interpret type theory in homotopy theory: so what?
*** Interesting for mathematicians: why?
*** Show all the people working on it.
*** Research question:
**** Why should we care?
**** What is \hott and why is it interesting to do programming in it?
**** Implementation details
*** Contribution
**** Introduction \hott aimed at \emph{programmers}
**** Focus on applications to programming
**** Focus on implementation issues
** What is a homotopy?
** Topology: study of spaces and continuous maps.
** Homotopy: study of continuous deformations
*** Start with a space
*** Points in a space
*** Paths between points
*** Homotopies between paths
*** Higher homotopies
** Paths and homotopies are interesting
*** Composition
**** Unit element
**** Invertible
**** Associative
*** Equalities hold up to homotopy one level higher
*** \inftygrpds
** Identity types
*** Introduce introduction rules
*** Introduce elimination principle
*** Show that we can nest identity types just like homotopies
*** Composition (|trans|)
*** Works just like homotopies do
** Function extensionality
*** Does not work
*** Why?
** UIP
*** Does not work
*** Why?
*** Introducing K
*** Can we prove K from J?
** J vs. K
*** Pictures
** n-types
*** Classify types along their identity types
*** What is the simplest identity type?
**** Trivial identity type -> contractible type
*** Definition n-truncated
*** \hprops
**** Proof irrelevance
*** \hsets
** \hits
*** How do we define a type that violates UIP / 1-type?
*** Canonicity ensures that we have UIP.
*** Violate canonicity: add axioms.
*** Higher inductive types
*** Example: circle
*** Example: interval
**** Function extensionality
** Univalence
*** Transporting isomorphisms
*** Monoid example
** Applications
*** Quotient types
**** \hits allow us to define quotient types
**** We show how one works with these
*** Views on abstract types
**** Univalence allows for a better specification of abstract types using views
**** We extend this to non-isomorphic types using quotient types
** Implementation efforts
*** Status quo: use postulates
*** Licata/Harper
*** Sozeau/Tabareau
*** Voevodsky's canonicity conjecture
** Conclusion
*** One (giant) step backwards: loss of pattern matching and canonicity
*** Two steps forward: \hits and univalence (function extensionality and lifting of isos)
*** Future work
**** Computational content univalence and \hits
**** Recover some form of pattern matching
* Erasing propositions
** |sort| example
** |elem| example
** Distinguish logical parts from program parts.
** Prop in Coq
** Irrelevance in Agda
** Collapsibility in Epigram
*** _<_ as an example of collapsible family: we can presuppose things
*** When can do this -> definition collapsible families
*** Concrete collapsibility
** Internalising collapsibility
*** Recall definition of collapsible family
*** Looks a lot like \hProp.
*** Does this mean we can internalise the collapsibility optimisation?
**** Write a term that produces an erased version given a proof of collapsibility.
**** Needs Agda's irrelevance: we can't just leave out stuff because of type checking.
*** Internal collapsibility
**** Does it coincide with collapsibility?
**** Note that we do not have the equality reflection rule
**** We want to optimise evaluation at run-time: evaluation in the empty context
**** In plain \MLTT: internal collapsibility implies collapsibility.
**** Are there collapsible families that are not internally collapsible?
***** Yes: Id A x y
**** Internal collapsibility is not enough for the optimisation
***** We need to know whether it is inhabited or not.
**** Time complexity issues
***** Effectiveness of optimisation depends on time complexity
***** Show how we can 
*** Internal collapsibility and \hott
**** We have seen that things work out in plain \MLTT
**** Does it work in \hott as well?
**** "Run-time" evaluation no longer in the empty context
**** We do not have that propositional equality implies definitional equality
**** Example: functions |Iid| and |Iconstzero| on the interval are propositionally equal, but definitionally different
**** Example: maps from |I| into |Bool| are alright.
**** Everything needs to be mapped to |refl|
**** Can we check this automatically?
***** No: |nattruncated| example
* Conclusions
** Is \hott interesting to do programming in it?
*** Yes: function extensionality, quotient types, type-generic lifting of isos
*** Not yet: computational content is lacking / we lose pattern matching 
** Can we use \hprops to identify parts of a program that can be erased
*** In plain \MLTT: yes
*** In \hott: generally not
** Can we internalise this optimisation?
*** Yes, if we assume extra properties
*** Time complexity is an issue
