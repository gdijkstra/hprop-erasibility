Front and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Wouter for the
guidance writing this thesis. Secondly, Paul deserves a mention for
hosting me in Bordeaux, renewing my motivation to work on this project
and letting me experience French culture, including but not limited to
air traffic control and train strikes. The people from BBL682 and
BBL681 provided much needed distractio. Last but not least, I would
like to thank my parents for their unconditional support.
