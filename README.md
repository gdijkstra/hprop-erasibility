Erasibility of hProp
====================

This project's goal is to find out whether we can devise useful
conditions under which hProp can be erased, as a run-time
optimisation. Since the definition of hProp looks a lot like Edwin
Brady's concept of collapsibility, we will study his work and check if
his results are still sensible and correct when applied to hProp.
